# AI Powered Career Advisor (Flutter)

Mobile app that helps students and professionals explore careers with a Gemini-powered chatbot, curated career knowledge base, and personalized suggestions. Auth is handled via Firebase (email/password + Google), conversations and profiles are stored in Firestore, and a local knowledge base drives the RAG prompt.

## Features
- Animated splash + onboarding to login/registration
- Firebase auth: email/password and Google Sign-In
- Profile collection (age, stream, education, degree, specialization, work status)
- Career chatbot with Gemini 2.0 Flash and guardrails for career-only guidance
- Retrieval-augmented answers from `assets/knowledge_base.txt`
- Conversation history (create/load/archive, message storage in Firestore)
- Career explorer bottom sheet to quickly ask about a role

## Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK ^3.9.2
- Firebase project (Firestore, Authentication, optionally Realtime DB/Storage)
- Google Cloud API key with Generative Language API enabled (Gemini)
- Android/iOS tooling (Xcode, Android Studio/SDK) depending on your target

## Setup
1) Install dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

2) Configure Firebase
- Run `firebase login` and `firebase use <your-project-id>` (or update `.firebaserc`).
- Add platform configs generated by FlutterFire:
  - `android/app/google-services.json`
  - `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
  - `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
  - `windows`/`linux` configs if you target those.

3) Add environment variables
Create a `.env` file at the repo root (already whitelisted in `pubspec.yaml`):
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

4) Run the app
```bash
flutter run
```

## Usage Flow
1) Splash (`StartPage`) animates into the onboarding screen.  
2) Register (`RegistrationPage`) or sign in (`LoginPage`); Google Sign-In is supported.  
3) Complete your profile (`UserInfoPage`) with stream/education/degree details.  
4) Chat in `CareerChatbotPage`; messages are saved per conversation in Firestore.  
5) Use the + button to open the career explorer sheet for quick role prompts.

## Key Packages
- `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`, `firebase_database`
- `google_sign_in`
- `http`, `flutter_dotenv`
- `google_fonts`, `lottie`

## Project Layout (selected)
- `lib/main.dart` – bootstrap, Firebase init, env load
- `lib/startpage.dart` – splash animation
- `lib/login.dart` / `lib/registration.dart` – auth flows
- `lib/userinfopage.dart` – profile capture
- `lib/careerchatbot.dart` – chat UI + Gemini calls
- `lib/services/` – Firestore chat/user services, RAG & knowledge base helpers
- `assets/knowledge_base.txt` – career data for retrieval context

## Testing
```bash
flutter test
```

## Troubleshooting
- Gemini errors: verify `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` and that the Generative Language API is enabled.
- Auth issues: confirm Firebase project configs are present for each platform.
- Missing assets: ensure `flutter pub get` was run and assets are listed in `pubspec.yaml`.
